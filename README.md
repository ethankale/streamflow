Streamflow for R
================
This package attempts to duplicate USGS stream gauging techniques, particularly those found in Technical Paper 2175.  It should also grow to encompass useful visualization and summarization tools.

It's not available on CRAN (yet), so install from GitHub using install_github from [devtools](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/): `install_github("ethankale/streamflow")`

Requires dplyr and ggplot to function correctly; maybe just install tidyverse.
