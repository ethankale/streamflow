Streamflow for R
================
This package attempts to duplicate USGS stream gauging techniques, particularly those found in [Water Resource Paper 2175](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/wsp2175/).  It should also grow to encompass useful visualization and summarization tools.

It's not available on CRAN (yet), so install from GitHub using install_github from [devtools](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/): `install_github("ethankale/streamflow")`

Requires dplyr and ggplot to function correctly; maybe just install tidyverse.
